1:
missing semicolon after the class definition:
class Projectile {
	...
}; // <-

2:
Class namespace missing in front of constructor name
arguments have to be double to match the types of 
position/velocity of the class
this is a reference, -> has to be used instead of .
Projectile::Projectile(double position, double velocity) {
	this->position = position;
	this->velocity = velocity;
}

3:
 a) method that takes an int pointer and returns an int pointer
 b) method that takes an int pointer and returns a const int pointer
 c) method that takes an int pointer and returns a const pointer of a const int
 d) method that takes a const int pointer and returns a const pointer of a const int
 e) method that takes a const int pointer and returns a const pointer of a const int 
     and doesn't change the object this method is a part of

5:
references:
 - get dereferenced automatically
 - can't change what it points to
 - can't be null

10:
no need to have int as const, as int is neither pointer nor reference
