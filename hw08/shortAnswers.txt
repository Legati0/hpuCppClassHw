2:
ownership determines which object has to delete heap memory 
that is shared across multiple objects

6:
the rule of five is an extension of the rule of three,
in short: if the class owns heap data, one shoud write a
- assignment operator
- copy constructor
- destructor
- move constructor
- move assignment operator

7:
instead of creating an object, and copying that object
once it gets returned, the object that is about to get
returned gets mapped on the variable it gets copied into
this way, there is no extra copy that has to be created

8:
copying creates a copy
moving moves the passed object and doesn't create a copy

12:
in the case that classes A and B include each other
without ifndef guards there would be an infinite loop
when trying to include the other header in the own header
using a forward declaration just says: this class exist,
no need to include the full header (only works with pointers
to objects, for full objects the compiler needs to 
know the size of an object = see full declaration of the 
object in question)
