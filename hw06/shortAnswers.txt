1:
to use code others already wrote, instead of rewriting
everything by yourself
grouping together bunch of object files for distribution

2:
static object and dynamically linked libs
static object: become part of your executable
dynamically linked: stay their own, code they contain
					gets loaded by the exe at runtime

3:
because the package manager installs other dependencies,
makes sure there is only one version that works for everything,
compiling code thats not your own is a pain
makes use of libraries easier

4:
run: main.o
	g++ -o run -L /usr/local/lib -lpng main.o 
main.o: main.cc
	g++ -c -I /usr/local/include main.cc

5:
a struct is a basic data structure. it can have
variables, but no methods. One might use it 
to bundle data together, so a function only takes
a Point oder Rectangle struct, instead of a high
number of parameters
